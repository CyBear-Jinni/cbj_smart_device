# Welcome!

This repository is in charge of controlling smart device's and is part of the [CyBear Jinni Smart Home](https://github.com/CyBear-Jinni/CBJ_Smart-Home.git) system.

These smart device's allow you to control lamps and blinds.
 
You can control these devices using physical buttons and from the [CyBear Jinni App](https://github.com/CyBear-Jinni/CBJ_App.git).

This part is using the snap store in order to have easy way to update all the device's software versions with new features and security updates.

## To get the project running

### Attention

* For now only NanoPi Duo2 is supported as smart device.

* You need to buy and solder the parts into the device yourself.


### Smart device preparations:

Setting up instructions for the new device can be found in the [CyBear Jinni Smart Device Resources](https://github.com/CyBear-Jinni/CBJ_Smart-Device_Resources.git) repository.

It is recommended to lock the IP of the smart device in the router settings if you intend to use the local option and not just the remote (that is using google Firebase platform).

Explanations on how to connect the device with the app will be given in the [CyBear Jinni App](https://github.com/CyBear-Jinni/CBJ_App.git) Readme file.


## Architecture

The code's based on DDD (Domain-Driven Design) principles, you can learn it from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMiN59x3uH0&list=PLB6lc7nQ1n4iS5p-IezFFgqP6YvAJy84U).
